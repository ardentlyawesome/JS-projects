# Basic JS Projects

This is a repository of Basic JavaScript Projects I made while learning JavaScript and other Web Development stuff. 

1. BlackJack: A website which implements the basic blackjack game. 

2. Color Flipper: A color flipper that generates random colors by their hex code. 

3. Passenger Counter: That acts as a basic counter, except it taught me how to use and implement arrays etc in JavaScript as it saves values in array etc.

These projects were made to implement JavaScript and prepare me for future projects in the field of Web Development.
